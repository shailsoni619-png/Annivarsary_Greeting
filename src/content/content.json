I've told everything to you in the past that how lucky I am and all that, but today I want to just thank you!\n\nThank you for existing. Thank you for coming all the way across the world away from your family and staying with me. Thank you for always being there for me in all the ups and downs we've been through. Thank you for every smile, every hug, every hard conversation, every silly joke, and every quiet moment where your hand found mine. Thank you for caring for my family, becoming one, and putting up with them always. Thank you for learning cooking for us and  now being an amazing cook that you are that everyone loves. Thank you for always going above and beyond to take care of me, tolerating my weaknesses and forgetfulness some time, and thanks for being patient. \n\nMost importantly, thanks for the best gift one can ever get that you gave to me and our families, that is our cutie Aaru. Our time at hospital will always be memorable and those few days changed our life forever. Thank you for being a phenomenal mom, who is also very hot, and taking care of two kids now.\n\nYou have made my life softer, stronger, and far more beautiful than I ever imagined. I do not care much about the future as I know with you being my side, its going to be awesome. With you being my side we can overcome any hurdles, so don't worry much. \n\nI am proud of everything we have built and even more excited for everything still ahead of us.\n\nNo matter where life takes us, my favorite place will always be right beside you in your arms (or you in my arms).\n\nWish you a very happy 6th anniversary and more 100s to come.\n\nI love you, endlessly. <3 <3"
